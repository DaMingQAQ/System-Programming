 Files:				Makefile, README, myParser.c
 Compile Instructions:		Run Makefile
 Operating Instructions:	Type parse, then enter sentences to be parsed followed by a $ on console. The sentences 
 				may be enter one at a time followed by a carriage return, or may be entered all on one 
 				line. Terminate program with $.
 Design Decisions:		Majority of code is borrowed from the sample parse.c file that is provided. Modifications
 				have been made to make the program fit with the grammar of this assignment (<Z>, <S>, and
 				<C>).
 Lessons Learned:		Top-down parsing, recursion, and the C language and its library.
